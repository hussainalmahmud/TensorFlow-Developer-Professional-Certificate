accuracy is in the 70%-80% range. This is a great example of overfitting -- which in short means that it can do very well with images it has seen before, but not so well with images it hasn't. Let's see if we can do better to avoid overfitting -- and one simple method is to augment the images a bit. If you think about it, most pictures of a cat are very similar -- the ears are at the top, then the eyes, then the mouth etc. Things like the distance between the eyes and ears will always be quite similar too. \n","\n","What if we tweak with the images to change this up a bit -- rotate the image, squash it, etc.  That's what image augementation is all about. And there's an API that makes it easy...\n","\n","Now take a look at the ImageGenerator. There are properties on it that you can use to augment the image. \n","\n","```\n","# Updated to do image augmentation\n","train_datagen = ImageDataGenerator(\n","      rotation_range=40,\n","      width_shift_range=0.2,\n","      height_shift_range=0.2,\n","      shear_range=0.2,\n","      zoom_range=0.2,\n","      horizontal_flip=True,\n","      fill_mode='nearest')\n","```\n","These are just a few of the options available (for more, see the Keras documentation. Let's quickly go over what we just wrote:\n","\n","* rotation_range is a value in degrees (0–180), a range within which to randomly rotate pictures.\n","* width_shift and height_shift are ranges (as a fraction of total width or height) within which to randomly translate pictures vertically or horizontally.\n","* shear_range is for randomly applying shearing transformations.\n","* zoom_range is for randomly zooming inside pictures.\n","* horizontal_flip is for randomly flipping half of the images horizontally. This is relevant when there are no assumptions of horizontal assymmetry (e.g. real-world pictures).\n","* fill_mode is the strategy used for filling in newly created pixels, which can appear after a rotation or a width/height shift.\n","\n","\n","Here's some code where we've added Image Augmentation.
